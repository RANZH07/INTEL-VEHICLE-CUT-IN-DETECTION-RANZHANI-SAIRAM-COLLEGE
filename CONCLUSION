The vehicle cut-in detection project leverages advanced technologies, including YOLOv8 for real-time object detection and OpenCV for video processing, to enhance driver safety on Indian roads. By accurately identifying various types of vehicles and calculating their speeds and distances, the system provides timely warnings for potential collisions, specifically when the time-to-collision (TTC) falls within the critical threshold of 0.5 to 0.7 seconds. This integration ensures robust performance in diverse driving conditions, offering a valuable tool for preventing accidents and promoting road safety. The project effectively combines state-of-the-art deep learning and computer vision techniques to deliver a practical and reliable solution for modern vehicular environments.
