The research focus involves utilizing the IDD dataset to perform a series of tasks aimed at improving driver safety through advanced machine learning models. This includes augmenting the training of these models with additional data from various sources to enhance their accuracy and robustness. The primary objective is to develop a system capable of detecting and tagging objects as soon as they appear, either partially or fully, in front of the driver. This system will also estimate the distance and Time-to-Collision (TTC) for these objects, providing timely warnings when the TTC falls below a predefined threshold, recommended to be between 0.5 and 0.7 seconds. The success criteria for this research are defined by the development of a fully functional ML model specifically for detecting cut-in scenarios, with a goal of achieving a true positive rate of 99% or higher for such detections.
